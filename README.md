Project Overview

This project is a Banking Management Database built using PostgreSQL / PL/pgSQL.
It contains 16 tables for core banking operations such as customers, accounts, employees, transactions, branches, and more.

The project also implements:

Primary Keys, Candidate Keys, Foreign Keys

 Triggers (for automatic balance updates & employee audits)

 Locking Mechanisms (row-level & table-level locks)

 Stored Procedures & Functions

 Transaction Management (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)

Employees â†’ Branches â†’ Audit Logs

Foreign keys enforce referential integrity

ðŸ“‘ Key Features

1. Customer Management

Store customer details (name, email, KYC, branch).



2. Account Management

Savings, Current, Loan accounts with balances.



3. Transaction Handling

Deposits, Withdrawals, Transfers.



4. Triggers

Example: Auto-update account balance on each transaction.


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_account_balance()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF NEW.transaction_type = 'deposit' THEN
        UPDATE accounts
        SET balance = balance + NEW.amount
        WHERE account_no = NEW.account_no;
    ELSIF NEW.transaction_type = 'withdraw' THEN
        UPDATE accounts
        SET balance = balance - NEW.amount
        WHERE account_no = NEW.account_no;
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


5. Employee Audit Logs

Every insert/update/delete on employees is recorded with TG_OP.



6. Locking System

Example of row-level lock:


BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_no = 101 FOR UPDATE;
COMMIT;


7. Transaction Safety

Use of ROLLBACK in case of errors.

ðŸ“Š Example Queries

Get total customers per branch:


SELECT branch_id, COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY branch_id;

View active locks:


SELECT relation::regclass AS table_name, mode, granted
FROM pg_locks
WHERE relation IS NOT NULL;
